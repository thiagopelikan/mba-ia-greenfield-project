# phase-03-videos — Context

## Scope

**Phase name:** Fase 03 — Upload e Processamento de Vídeos

**Capabilities** (literal, `docs/project-plan.md`):

- Serviço de armazenamento de arquivos (vídeos e thumbnails)
- Serviço de processamento em segundo plano (filas)
- Upload de vídeos com suporte a arquivos de até 10GB sem impacto na performance
- Pré-cadastro automático do vídeo como rascunho ao iniciar o upload
- Processamento automático do vídeo após upload (extração de duração e metadados)
- Geração automática de thumbnail a partir de um frame do vídeo
- URL única por vídeo, sem conflito com outros vídeos
- Reprodução via streaming (sem necessidade de download completo)
- Download do vídeo pelo usuário

**Out of scope:** Edição de informações do vídeo, categorias, visibilidade público/unlisted e fluxo rascunho → publicação (Fase 04); player, página de visualização e contagem de visualizações (Fase 05); interações sociais (Fase 06); listagens/busca (Fase 07). Interface de vídeo no `next-frontend/`.

**Deliverables:** upload de até 10GB funcional, processamento automático do vídeo, streaming funcionando, URLs únicas geradas.

**Affected subprojects:** `nestjs-project/`

**Deferred subprojects:** `next-frontend/` — the phase has no UI capability bullet; the video interface is out of scope for this delivery (cross-layer TDs define the contract for a later phase).

**Sequencing notes:** Depends on Fase 01 — Configuração Base do Projeto and Fase 02 — Cadastro, Login e Gerenciamento de Conta (videos belong to the channel created per user in Fase 02). Pontos de Atenção (project-plan §4) relevant to this phase: upload of large files must not lock the system and should allow resuming after a connection failure; heavy processing runs in background; short unique URLs; storage growth/cost; streaming without full download.

**Neighbors (for boundary detection only):**

- **Phase 02:** Cadastro, Login e Gerenciamento de Conta — users, channels (1:1), JWT auth, error contract.
- **Phase 04:** Gerenciamento de Vídeos e Canal — categories, video info editing, custom thumbnail, visibility, draft → publication flow, channel dashboard.

## Decisions Detail

### phase-03-videos/TD-01

**Recommendation:** it gives job semantics the phase needs (retries with backoff, deterministic job ids, failed-job retention) with the official NestJS integration and zero custom plumbing, and it materializes the architecture's dedicated "Message Queue" container; the Postgres backend (B) is attractive for avoiding a container but is two months old and less documented through `@nestjs/bullmq`, and RabbitMQ (C) would require hand-building retry/backoff via dead-letter exchanges for a single job type.

**Libraries:** bullmq, @nestjs/bullmq, ioredis

### phase-03-videos/TD-02

**Recommendation:** it is the only option where no video byte crosses the API, which is the literal requirement ("sem impacto na performance"), it gives resume after connection loss via `ListParts` (project-plan §4), and it stays within AWS S3's 5 GiB single-PUT limit when MinIO is swapped for S3. Suggested policy: max size 10 GiB (10,737,418,240 bytes) validated at initiate time, fixed part size of 64 MiB (≤ 160 parts for 10 GiB, far from the 10,000-part limit), presigned part URLs valid for a bounded window (e.g., 1 hour) and re-issuable on resume.

**Note:** User accepted the recommendation, noting that this is an MBA demo project and 10GB uploads will not occur in practice; the strategy is still implemented and tested at the contract level (size limit, part plan) with small real files.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-03

**Recommendation:** it presigns every multipart command needed by TD-02's direct upload and is the reference behavior for the production S3 target, keeping MinIO → S3 a configuration swap; the MinIO client lacks presigned multipart part URLs.

**Note:** User delegated this choice to the recommendation ("deixo você sugerir"), reminding that the project is an MBA demo with no real production use.

**Libraries:** @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner

### phase-03-videos/TD-04

**Recommendation:** it keeps a single access model where the API decides every read, which Phase 03 needs for drafts and Phase 04/05 need for visibility, with collision-free keys derived from the video UUID; stable CDN URLs for thumbnails (Option B) can be introduced later without migrating originals.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-05

**Recommendation:** it honors the architecture's separate worker container and keeps FFmpeg off the API event loop while reusing the entity, config and storage modules instead of duplicating them; a standalone subproject (C) adds duplication with no requirement demanding language or release independence.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-06

**Recommendation:** it avoids copying up to 10GB per job while keeping FFmpeg as the only dependency, and `fluent-ffmpeg` is unsupported. Suggested policy: persist `duration_seconds` plus a `metadata` JSON (container format, size, bitrate, width, height, frame rate, video/audio codecs); take the thumbnail at 10% of the duration clamped to [0 s, duration − 0.1 s], scaled to 1280 px wide JPEG; bounded execution timeout per command.

**Libraries:** ffmpeg (Debian package in the Docker image — not an npm dependency)

### phase-03-videos/TD-07

**Recommendation:** it reflects the required cycle with the fewest states, lets BullMQ retries absorb transient errors before marking `failed`, and leaves publication/visibility to dedicated Phase 04 columns.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-08

**Recommendation:** short and unguessable URLs without a new dependency, with uniqueness enforced by the database and a retry path consistent with the existing nickname generation pattern; enumerable Sqids (C) would undermine future unlisted videos.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-09

**Recommendation:** progressive range streaming satisfies "sem necessidade de download completo" while keeping the API out of the byte path as the architecture intends, and one mechanism covers both streaming and download; HLS (C) can be added later as an additional rendition without changing the API contract.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-10

**Recommendation:** it realizes the anonymous-viewing principle and a shareable unique URL now, never exposes unfinished videos, and lets Phase 04 add visibility as an extra filter on the same endpoints.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-11

**Recommendation:** it covers client retries and duplicate enqueues with no extra infrastructure; the only uncovered window (process crash between two local calls) is narrow and can be addressed later with a sweeper, whereas an outbox adds a table and a relay for one job type.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-12

**Recommendation:** it keeps the `draft` status truthful and reclaims orphaned parts through the queue and worker that this phase already builds, independent of per-environment bucket configuration; a 24h upload window is generous for a 10GB file on any realistic connection, and storage-level lifecycle rules can still be added in production as a second safety net.

**Libraries:** —

## Inherited Decisions Detail

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/config) — Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/config@^4.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (Joi) — First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.

**Libraries:** `joi@^17.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Namespaced/grouped with registerAs) — The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`. Initial files for Phase 01: `src/config/database.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (Shared registerAs factory) — Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.

**Libraries:** `dotenv` (transitive via `@nestjs/config`)

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.

**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation during implementation — custom guards were preferred over `@nestjs/passport` to keep the dependency surface smaller; social login is not on the near-term roadmap, so the plugin-architecture benefit did not justify the extra abstraction layer.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.

**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation — JWT was kept to reuse the access-token signing/verification infrastructure (`@nestjs/jwt`), trading token size and base64-readability for a single token format across the codebase.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Architectural fit.** The strict-BFF model in `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` already nominates the Route Handler as the only NestJS caller; cookie-based sessions are the natural match, and Auth.js's framework adds layers between the BFF and the cookie that buy nothing because the backend is the auth authority — Auth.js's value (DB adapters, OAuth providers, magic-link, `getServerSession` helpers) is mostly unused in this configuration. (2) **Smaller blast radius.** A ~50-LOC session helper is grep-friendly, debuggable, and test-friendly via the existing MSW+BFF integration test pattern; a misconfigured Auth.js callback is a longer fault-isolation loop. (3) **Compatibility with Next.js 16 / React 19.** Built-in `next/headers` `cookies()` is the canonical primitive both runtimes already use; Auth.js v5 versions track Next.js majors with a lag, adding compatibility risk that Option A does not have. Option C is rejected as unsafe (`localStorage` for refresh tokens) and architecturally regressive (loses RSC personalization).
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Defense in depth on the cookie content** — `httpOnly` blocks JS, encryption blocks accidental log/proxy inspection; the marginal cost is one ~3KB dep. (2) **Single cookie to manage** simplifies logout (one `session.destroy()` call) and avoids the orphan-cookie failure mode of Option A. (3) **Room to carry minimal user metadata** (`userId`, `email`, `channelSlug`) lets `app/layout.tsx` RSC render the authenticated chrome (avatar, channel name) without a per-render `/auth/me` round-trip — Phase 04+ gains compound here. Option A is a viable downgrade if the team rejects `iron-session` for any reason; the migration A→B (or B→A) is a one-Route-Handler refactor with no test changes downstream because the BFF interface is unchanged. Option C is rejected: it solves a problem (server-side revocation) the project does not have at the cost of infrastructure the project does not own.
**Libraries:** iron-session

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-03

**Recommendation:** The single-flight detail is non-trivial and goes in the helper from day one — tested by MSW with a "two concurrent intercepted upstream calls; one refresh expected" assertion. Option B's client-driven pattern is rejected because it doesn't replace Option A (RSC still needs server-side refresh) — adopting B means doing both. Option C's pre-emptive timer is rejected because the failure modes (multiple tabs, sleep/wake) outweigh the latency saving and force a `"use client"` shell near the root.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Decoupled from TD-05** — works with Route Handlers OR Server Actions; the form code does not change if TD-05 is revisited later. (2) **Aligned with shadcn's canonical form primitive** — the project already commits to `radix-nova` shadcn (`components.json`); `npx shadcn@latest add form` produces react-hook-form wrappers; choosing react-hook-form means using the supported primitive instead of hand-rolling around it. (3) **Zod-first developer ergonomics match the rest of the FE foundation** — `next-frontend-config-base/TD-01` chose Zod 4 for env; the same schemas-as-source-of-truth pattern carries to forms with zero new validator paradigm. Option B is rejected for impedance with shadcn's primitive and for over-investing in progressive-enhancement that the strict-BFF model does not require. Option C is rejected for the per-field boilerplate and the loss of client-side feedback on a project that values quick, type-safe form iteration.
**Libraries:** react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Strict-BFF alignment.** `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` named Route Handlers as the BFF surface; Option A keeps every mutation visible under `app/api/**`. (2) **Test scaffold already exists** — `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Testing and `next-frontend-msw-foundation` were authored for Route-Handlers-as-functions; Option A reuses them with zero invention. (3) **Single mutation surface** — Phase 02 sets the precedent for Phases 03–07; uniformity beats per-mutation idiom-picking when the cost of inconsistency compounds (Option C). Option B has real ergonomic appeal for the simplest forms but fragments the BFF surface and forces test-pattern reinvention; if the team later wants progressive enhancement for specific forms, the migration A→B is per-form and doesn't require touching unrelated routes — A is the safer default and the cheaper baseline.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Two reinforcing reasons. (1) **No first-render flicker, no round-trip** — the session is delivered in the same response as the page HTML; the Client Provider hydrates with the correct initial state; users never see "Login" briefly turn into their avatar. (2) **No new BFF endpoint** — the cookie is the source of truth, RSC reads it, the Provider broadcasts it; the BFF surface stays minimal. The `router.refresh()` requirement after mid-session mutations is a small price (one line in the relevant mutation handler) for the structural benefits. Option B is rejected for the double-read-and-flicker; Option C is dominated by Option B and rejected.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **First-paint-correct** — the user sees the right outcome on the first paint, no skeleton, no flicker. (2) **Single integration pattern across both flows** — confirmation is RSC-only; reset is RSC + Client form (TD-04, TD-05 patterns reused) — both share the "RSC owns the token, Client Component owns the input" split. (3) **Email-prefetch behavior** is solved at the backend's idempotent-confirmation level (a small note for `/plan-build` to confirm; not a separate TD). Option B's Route-Handler-as-link-target adds redirects for no clean gain. Option C is dominated.
**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-01

**Recommendation:** é a única opção que preserva as decisões anteriores (`class-validator` em TD-06 de phase-02-auth) sem re-platform; o CLI plugin com `classValidatorShim: true` aproveita os decoradores `class-validator` existentes para inferir schemas, mantendo o boilerplate baixo. Nestia tem mérito técnico real mas o custo de migração do stack de validação inviabiliza-a sem uma decisão upstream de supersede de TD-06. Manual authoring é descartado.
**Libraries:** @nestjs/swagger

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-02

**Recommendation:** o custo marginal sobre Option A é apenas um npm script (~15 linhas) e o benefício é uma fundação correta para futura integração FE (codegen offline) sem perder a UI interativa que dev/QA usam. Option B sozinho pune a experiência de desenvolvimento em dev/local; Option A sozinho compromete o pipeline de codegen futuro. Combinar é dominante.
**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-03

**Recommendation:** alinha com a postura defensiva já estabelecida em phase 02 e não compromete consumidores legítimos (o `openapi.json` commitado em TD-02 cumpre o papel de "spec consultável fora da UI"). Re-abrir como Option A ou C é trivial no futuro se um caso de uso de API pública aparecer.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three converging reasons: (1) **Type-inference matches the FE's strict-TS culture** — `lib/env.ts` exports a typed `env` object with no `as` casts, satisfying the project's "Type Safety" working principle. (2) **Ecosystem gravity in Next.js / React 19** — Zod is the de-facto schema language for App Router (Server Actions inputs, form resolvers, future contract validation), so introducing it once at the env layer compounds value for forms in Phase 02+. (3) **Direct enablement of TD-02 Option A (`@t3-oss/env-nextjs`)** — t3-env's first-citizen validator. Backend parity with Joi is not load-bearing: env schemas are not shared FE↔BE (different runtimes, different key sets); two validators across two subprojects is a bounded cost.
**Libraries:** zod

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** The only option that combines (i) **type-level NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix enforcement**, (ii) **runtime Proxy-based leak detection**, and (iii) **single-file, single-import-path consumer ergonomics**. Option B reaches roughly the same _structural_ outcome at higher implementation and maintenance cost, with a weaker guarantee (no prefix enforcement, no proxy). Option C is unsafe at any non-trivial team size. The marginal cost over B is one ~3KB dep — well-spent for the strongest boundary among the three.
**Libraries:** @t3-oss/env-nextjs

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Aligned with the BFF testing strategy and architectural commitment already documented in `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` (Route Handlers as the only NestJS caller; BFF tests stub `fetch` via MSW). Eliminates CORS, eliminates public exposure of the backend URL, and produces the smallest correct foundation. Option B's `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is a future-proofing concession with no current consumer — and adding a public key later is a non-breaking change, while removing one is breaking. Option C ties a foundational decision to infra work explicitly deferred elsewhere. The Docker networking gap (how server-in-container resolves the backend) is a separate orthogonal decision, surfaced below.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-msw-foundation/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **MSW's own best-practice recommends it** — the project should not invent its own scheme when the official one is documented and matches the codebase's domain orientation. (2) **Domain ownership tracks the codebase**, not the project plan — `components/`, `app/api/`, and any future feature folders will be organized by domain (auth, videos, channels), so handler files mirror that vocabulary and remain stable as phases come and go. (3) **Append-only growth with minimal merge conflicts** — each phase touches a new file plus one line in the barrel, which is the smallest practical concurrent-PR footprint. Option A is acceptable through Phase 02 alone (~5–7 endpoints) but accumulates costs that B avoids from day one; bootstrapping directly into B costs one extra file and one barrel and pays off by Phase 03. Option C's phase coupling is rejected outright — domain-by-phase is a category error.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-msw-foundation/TD-02

**Recommendation:** The browser worker is a future capability with no documented current consumer; wiring it now (Option B) is speculative investment, and wiring it incoherently (Option C) actively misleads developers into thinking interception works when it doesn't under strict BFF. Option A keeps the foundation minimal, aligns 1:1 with everything CLAUDE.md and the existing rules currently document, and is non-breaking to extend.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-msw-foundation/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Reasons: (1) **Option B's determinism + readability is the right baseline** — every fixture in Phase 02 (5–7 endpoints, single-record-mostly) is naturally hand-written, and the diff-revealing override pattern is the highest-value benefit. (2) **Bulk-collection cases will arrive (Phase 07 home page grid, Phase 06 comment threads) and inline hand-written lists of 20+ items are genuinely tedious** — keeping faker available as a scoped tool is pragmatic. (3) **Per-fixture local seeding eliminates the global-cursor pitfall** that makes Option C structurally fragile — using `faker.seed(N)` immediately before a collection-builder run scopes the determinism to that fixture and isolates it from upstream changes to other factories.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-msw-foundation/TD-04

**Recommendation:** The user's "import only what it needs" requirement is satisfied at the *authoring* layer by TD-01 (per-domain files; each phase adds one file). At the *runtime* layer, loading all handlers is the canonical MSW v2 model and imposes no cost on tests that don't fetch the extra URLs. `onUnhandledRequest: "error"` enforces that a phase's test cannot accidentally invoke a route outside its scope (the fetch fails loudly with "no handler matched"), which is the strongest version of "stays inside its phase" available. Option B's per-suite composition pays real boilerplate cost for an explicitness gain that TD-01 already provides at a different layer. Option C invents a Vitest-projects-shaped problem for a phase-shaped concern.

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three reinforcing reasons. (1) **Strict BFF makes the SDK surface valueless on the client.** Only Route Handlers ever call the upstream Nest; they already use `fetch` (Next 16's caching extensions sit on top of native `fetch`); a generated SDK adds a third client style to learn for zero functional gain. (2) **Types-first matches the rest of the FE foundation.** Env validation is Zod-derived types; component variants are `cva` types; both are TS-first with zero generated runtime. `paths` is the natural extension — one `.d.ts` file imported wherever the contract is touched. (3) **MSW typing is solved by the same `paths` symbol.** Hand-written handlers in `mocks/handlers.ts` type their resolver returns off `paths["/videos"]["get"]["responses"][200]`, giving the contract guarantee without orval/kubb's verbose generated handlers (which would be overridden per-test anyway). The marginal cost of adding `openapi-fetch` (~6KB, server-side only) is small enough that we recommend the **types + thin-client** pair, not types alone — `openapi-fetch` removes the `fetch(API_URL + path, { method, headers, body })` boilerplate in each Route Handler while staying within the BFF model. Options B/C/D may be revisited if (a) client-side data-fetching enters the stack with TanStack Query and per-endpoint hooks are wanted, or (b) the API grows beyond ~20 operations and per-call boilerplate becomes painful.

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Preserves the compose-stack independence** that `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` Context calls out as the current architecture — neither subproject's compose file references the other. (2) **Drift is eliminated structurally when paired with TD-03's CI freshness check** — the check runs the sync script and asserts no diff on either `openapi.json` or `types.gen.ts`, so a backend PR that forgets to re-sync fails CI with a clear message. (3) **The committed local file is a real artifact in PR review** — reviewers see the contract change in `next-frontend/openapi.json`'s diff at the same time as the backend change, doubling the visibility (an `openapi.json`-only diff in a feature PR is a red flag for accidental drift). Option A is acceptable as a pre-CI fallback; Option C is rejected because the cross-stack file dependency in `docker-compose.yaml` introduces coupling that the current architecture explicitly avoids, and the "no drift" gain over B is small once TD-03 lands.

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-03

**Recommendation:** It is the only option that makes contract drift _both_ visible (in PR diffs) _and_ impossible to merge accidentally (CI fail). The complexity premium over Option A is one CI step. Option B's "no committed artifacts" purity is poorly paid for in a monorepo where the cross-subproject build coupling becomes a real ergonomic cost, and it wastes the PR visibility that TD-02 Option B's committed `openapi.json` is specifically designed to deliver. Option A is acceptable as a temporary state until the CI pipeline lands; downgrading from C to A is reversible (just remove the CI step) but upgrading to C later requires explaining `types.gen.ts` history in a separate commit. Start at C. Apply the same script-and-check pattern to any future generated artifact (e.g., if `openapi-fetch` is wrapped, the wrapper file is hand-written; the only generated artifact remains `types.gen.ts`).
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-04

**Recommendation:** It is the only option that (i) handles pass-through and reshape with the same mechanism, (ii) gives a single grep target for "what shape does the BFF expose", and (iii) decouples Component imports from App Router file paths (Components import `from "@/lib/api/contracts"`, not `from "@/app/api/videos/route"`). Option B is theoretically minimal but fragile against Next's actual RSC/Client/Route-Handler typing; Option C scatters the contract surface and creates drift opportunities. The "long file" concern is bounded — for the scope of StreamTube, the BFF will likely have <30 contract aliases at peak; sectioning by feature header comments is sufficient. Make `lib/api/contracts.ts` the only file that imports `paths` from `types.gen.ts` (lintable later); every other consumer imports from `contracts.ts`.
**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Reasons: (1) **Determinism over auto-generation** — BFF integration tests assert on specific values; randomized fixtures are anti-helpful. (2) **Coherence with TD-01 recommendation** — `openapi-typescript`'s `paths` type is the single contract anchor; reusing it in MSW handlers means "spec ↔ handler ↔ assertion" is one type chain. (3) **Scale fit** — Phase 02 introduces few endpoints; the manual cost is negligible at this stage. If the API grows to dozens of endpoints and authoring overhead becomes real, this TD can be superseded with a Kubb-or-hey-api MSW plugin without touching TD-01's `paths` import sites (the generator just produces additional handler files; the existing manual handlers stay valid). Option B locks the project into a heavier TD-01 choice for marginal mock-authoring savings; Option C is Option A with an unnecessary detour.

## Inherited Conventions

- Backend config uses `@nestjs/config` with namespaced `registerAs(name, () => ({...}))` factories — one file per domain in `src/config/`. _(from phase 01)_
- Env variables are validated by a Joi schema in `src/config/env.validation.ts`, passed to `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validationSchema, validationOptions: { allowUnknown: true, abortEarly: false } })`. _(from phase 01)_
- Config is injected into modules via `ConfigType<typeof xxxConfig>` and `@Inject(xxxConfig.KEY)`; the same factory is importable as a plain function for non-DI contexts (e.g., TypeORM CLI). _(from phase 01)_
- `data-source.ts` loads `.env` via `import 'dotenv/config'` at the top, then imports `databaseConfig` and calls it as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- Database connection parameters (host, port, etc.) are sourced from a single `databaseConfig` factory — never duplicated between `AppModule` and `data-source.ts`. _(from phase 01)_
- `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` is used (not `forRoot`), with `imports: [ConfigModule]`, `inject: [databaseConfig.KEY]`, `useFactory` returning options including `autoLoadEntities: true`, `synchronize: false`. _(from phase 01)_

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de frontend | deferred | phase-01-configuracao-base | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| "Confirmação de conta via e-mail com link de ativação" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — UI landing screen de-scoped; FE confirmation flow picked up by a future phase. |
| "Logout" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — logout button lives inside authenticated chrome (typically Phase 04). |
| "Recuperação de senha (destination screen / set-new-password)" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — reset-password destination screen absent from Figma. |
| "Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | umbrella bullet deferred until the missing screens land. |
